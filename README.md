## Overview
I have just started to learn frontend end development, i had just completed my html and css course and i wanted to practice it and then i found-out about frontend mentor and i just signed up for free, looked up for beginner level challenges and entered in this challenge.

Making the qr code component was not so easy as i didn't had figma or sketch files. But yeah i finally did it, i tried hard to make it look exactly like the original one.

## My process

I first created a mockup of the qr-code component using figma and then wrote the html file and then wrote css using flexbox following mobile first workflow method.

### Built with
-Figma (own mockup)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for creating my own mockup. I really liked this pattern of creating own mockup of the design and will use it going forward.
- [MDN WEBDOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand FLEXBOX. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
